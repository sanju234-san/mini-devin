"""Agent gateway and metrics provider protocols and default stubs.

This module defines the boundaries between the REST API layer (owned by
Tamanna) and the multi-agent orchestration layer (owned by Sanjeevni).

By depending on these protocols rather than importing `app.agents` directly:
1. The REST API runs independently without waiting for agent implementation.
2. Unit and integration tests can easily substitute mock gateways.
3. Merge conflicts between backend routes and agent logic are prevented.
