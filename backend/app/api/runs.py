"""Create, list, fetch agent runs, and handle human plan decisions.

This module provides the core run lifecycle endpoints:
- GET  /runs:                      Paginated list of recent runs (summaries, newest first).
- GET  /runs/{run_id}:             Full details of a single run, including issue body.
- POST /runs/{run_id}/plan/decision: Submit a human plan decision (approve / edit / reject).

Plan Approval Walkthrough (beginner-friendly)
----------------------------------------------
1. The Planner agent finishes and the run pauses at status 'awaiting_plan_approval'.
2. The frontend fetches the plan via the existing artifact routes (GET /runs/{id}/artifacts).
3. The developer reads the plan and clicks Approve / Edit / Reject in the UI.
4. The UI POSTs to /runs/{run_id}/plan/decision with a JSON body like:
       {"decision": "approve"}
5. This endpoint atomically claims the decision (only one request wins even if
   two arrive simultaneously) and returns 202 with the updated RunSummary.
6. A background task then calls the PlanResumer (Sanjeevni's agent layer) to
   resume the paused LangGraph graph. If that call fails, the run is marked
   failed; the 202 response is already on its way to the client.
7. The developer can poll GET /runs/{run_id} or watch the WebSocket stream to
   see the run progress to 'running' and eventually to 'completed'.

Error codes:
- 404: Unknown run ID.
- 409: Run is not awaiting plan approval (wrong status or decision already made).
- 422: Invalid request body (bad decision value, missing edited_plan, etc.).
