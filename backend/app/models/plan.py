"""Plan decision schemas for the human approval workflow.

Plain-language overview
-----------------------
When the Planner agent finishes writing its implementation plan, the run
pauses and waits for a human developer to review it. The developer can:

  * approve - accept the plan as-is; the Coder starts immediately.
  * edit    - submit a corrected version of the plan; the Coder uses the
              edited version (stored as a separate artifact so the original
              is preserved).
  * reject  - decline the plan entirely; the run is terminated.

This module defines the Pydantic schemas for that decision request (sent
by the frontend to POST /runs/{run_id}/plan/decision) and the internal
record the store keeps once a decision has been made.

    ----------------
    - decision must be one of: approve, edit, reject.
    - edited_plan is required when decision == 'edit' and is forbidden for
      approve/reject (to avoid ambiguous payloads).
    - edited_plan JSON serialisation must be <= 64 KiB.
    - reason is optional for any decision (max 2 000 characters). The
      backend stores it internally but never echoes it back in responses.
    - Extra fields are rejected (extra='forbid') to catch client typos early.
